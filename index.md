# Obstacle Avoiding Robot
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was plugging in and connecting the ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensor reports the distance between itself and the nearest obstacle by utilizing how quickly sound waves are inputted and outputted. I inserted the ultrasonic sensor into the breadboard and connected the male-to-male jumper wires into the Arduino. At first, the ultrasonic sensor was unresponsive, which I fixed through calling the delay() method between inputting and outputting the audio.
